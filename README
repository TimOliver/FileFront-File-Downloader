In 2009, Ziff Davis made an announcement that 
due to funding, FileFront would be shut down
and all files it was hosting would be deleted.

In response to this, a massive initiative began
where many users started downloading all of the files
off FileFront's various video game subdomains
in order to save them from digital oblivion.

As part of this initiative, a Python script was hastily
devised to automate the downloading and archival
of such files. This script was posted on the UberGames
forum in 2009, and has been available there since.

At the last second, the original owners of FileFront
swooped in and purchased FileFront off Ziff Davis,
saving it.

In late 2011, amidst a rumour that FileFront might 
potentially be facing another shutdown, I updated
the original script so it would work with FileFront's
modern implementation.

***********************************************

I am providing this script, as is, so that people
may be able to quickly access it in the event another
mass FileFront-archival initiative becomes necessary.

Please note: Due to the absolute massive amounts
of bandwidth this script is able to make your system
consume (On both FileFront's and your own behalf), 
I would not recommend using this script unless such a time.

Due to the nature of page-scraping, this script
may stop working at any time.
